"""
Anti-detection module for verificacion-correo.

This module provides advanced anti-detection techniques to evade
Microsoft OWA's anti-scraping protections, including:

- NoDriver integration (undetected Chrome automation)
- Mouse movement emulation with BÃ©zier curves
- Human typing patterns simulation
- Random delays with realistic distributions
- User-Agent rotation

These techniques significantly improve the success rate of extracting
contact information, particularly the name field which is typically
blocked by OWA's anti-scraping measures.
